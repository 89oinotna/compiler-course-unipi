# Languages, Compilers and Interpreters (Lab) - 3 CFU
**Teacher**: Letterio Galletta

**Page of theory part**: http://pages.di.unipi.it/gori/Linguaggi-Compilatori2020/

## Course description
The course will present tools and techniques used in the implementation of programming languages. 
In particular, the course will guide students in the implementation of a compiler for a small 
subset of language C, called *MicroC*, and of an interpreter of a small functional language, called *FUN*. 


## Learning objectives

After completing the course, students will have  
* Known the basics of the functional programming language OCaml
* Implemented parsers using state-of-the-art parsers generators 
* Designed and implemented semantic analyses for a functional and an imperative languages
* Used the LLVM toolchain for generating and optimize code 
* Had some fun along the way! 


## Material
### Software
Programming assignments will use the following pieces of sotfware:
* [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) - try to install the latest version. All the code shown during the course is tested with **the version 4.10.1**. 
* [Opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/) - OCaml package manager.
* [Menhir](http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/) - a LR(1) parser generator for the OCaml programming language.
* [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) - a compiler for C programs.
* [LLVM](http://llvm.org/) - The LLVM compiler infrastructure. All the code shown during the course is tested with **the version 10.0**.
